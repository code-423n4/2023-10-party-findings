## Introduction

&nbsp;the Party Protocol is designed to bring a social and cooperative element to the Ethereum blockchain.

1.  **Group Coordination:** The protocol helps people come together and form groups on the Ethereum blockchain. These groups could be for various purposes—maybe pooling funds for a shared goal, coordinating activities, or any other collaborative effort.
    
2.  **On-chain Functionality:** The Party Protocol doesn't just rely on off-chain interactions. It provides tools and features that are executed directly on the Ethereum blockchain. This ensures transparency, security, and trust in the coordination process.
    
3.  **Distribution:** Once the group achieves its goal or completes a specific task, the protocol likely has mechanisms for distributing rewards, benefits, or whatever was collectively achieved. This could involve the automatic execution of smart contracts to distribute assets among the participants.
    
4.  **Making Ethereum Multiplayer:** The ultimate goal seems to be enhancing the social aspect of Ethereum. Rather than just individual interactions, the Party Protocol aims to make Ethereum more multiplayer, fostering collaboration and shared experiences.
    

In summary, the Party Protocol is like a set of rules and tools for people to form groups, coordinate activities, and share in the success on the Ethereum blockchain. It's all about bringing a social dynamic to the decentralized world!

### phases

The protocol has two top-level phases that a Party can be in: crowdfund and governance.

1\. Crowdfund

&nbsp;Where users contribute ETH to become a member of a Party, granting them voting rights and proportional ownership of the Party.

2\. Governance

Where Party Members can create and vote on proposals to perform actions as a Party.

### What is party

A Party is the core unit of the protocol and functions like a group Ethereum account. Each Party has members, an inventory, and governance capabilities that allow it to perform actions on-chain.

A Party's members hold membership NFTs, each of which has a specific amount of voting power associated with it. Party members can create and vote on proposals, which define possible actions for the Party to execute. If the Party was started via a crowdfund, contributors will have membership NFTs in the Party with voting power proportional to their crowdfund contribution.

## Audit Approach

1.  **Initial Scope and Documentation Review**: Thoroughly went through the Contest Readme File and project documentation to understand the protocol's objectives and functionalities.
    
2.  **High-level Architecture Understanding**: Performed an initial architecture review of the codebase by going through all files without going into function details.
    
3.  **Test Environment Setup and Analysis**: Set up a test environment and execute all tests. Additionally, use Static Analyzer tools like Slither to identify potential vulnerabilities.
    
4.  **Comprehensive Code Review**: Conducted a line-by-line code review focusing on understanding code functionalities.
    
    - **Understand Codebase Functionalities**: Began by going through the functionalities of the codebase to gain a clear understanding of its operations.
    - **Identify Access Control Issues**: Thoroughly examine the codebase for any access control problems that might allow unauthorized users to execute critical functions.
    - **Evaluate Function Execution Order**: Checked random sequence of function executions to ensure the protocol's logic cannot be disrupted by changing the order of calls.
    - **Assess State Variable Handling**: Identify state variables and assess the possibility of breaking assumptions to manipulate them into exploitable states, leading to unintended exploitation of the protocol's functionality.
5.  **Report Writing**: Write a Report by compiling all the insights I gained throughout the line-by-line code review.
    

## Architecture recommendations

I suggest having the contract under audit equipped with a complete set of NatSpec detailing all input and output parameters pertaining to each functions although much has been done in specifying each @dev. Additionally, a thorough set of flowcharts, and if possible a video walkthrough, could mean a lot to the developers/auditors/users in all areas of interests.

## Contracts

- **InitialETHCrowdfund.sol**: it extends from `ETHCrowdfundBase` and uses several utility libraries for operations like casting and address manipulation.
    
- &nbsp;**ETHCrowdfundBase.sol**: it  is used to create and manage a crowdfunding campaign in Ethereum. The contract includes functions for initializing the crowdfunding campaign, processing contributions, finalizing the campaign, and handling emergency situations.
    
    Key features of the contract:
    
    1.  Crowdfunding Lifecycle: The contract defines different stages of a crowdfunding campaign - Active, Lost, Won, and Finalized.
        
    2.  Contribution Limits: The contract allows setting minimum and maximum contribution limits for each contributor and for the total campaign.
        
    3.  Voting Power: Contributors receive voting power proportional to their contribution. The conversion rate can be set during the initialization of the campaign.
        
    4.  Funding Split: A portion of the contributions can be sent to a different recipient. This is useful for cases where a part of the funds raised needs to be allocated to a different party.
        
    5.  Emergency Actions: The contract includes an emergency function that allows the DAO to execute arbitrary function calls from the contract. This can be disabled by the DAO or the party host.
        
- **PartyGovernance.sol:** Base contract for a Party encapsulating all governance functionality.
    
- **PartyGovernanceNFT.sol:** it is extends form  `PartyGovernance`, `ERC721`, and `IERC2981`. It's a governance contract for a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that uses NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) to represent voting power.
    
- **ProposalExecutionEngine.sol:**  is used to execute various types of proposals in a decentralized organization or DAO. The contract is designed to be upgradable and uses delegate calls to execute the logic of the proposals.
    
- ****ProposalStorage.sol****: it is an abstract contract that is used to manage the storage of proposals in a decentralized governance system. The contract uses a pattern known as "explicit storage buckets" to manage storage. This pattern is used to share storage between different contracts in an upgradeable contract system.
    
- **SetGovernanceParameterProposal.sol**: `SetGovernanceParameterProposal`, is a part of a decentralized governance system. It allows for the modification of three governance parameters: `voteDuration`, `executionDelay`, and `passThresholdBps`.
    
- **SetSignatureValidatorProposal.sol**:  it is an abstract contract that manages signature validators for different hashes. It uses the ERC1271 standard for signature validation.
    
- **OffChainSignatureValidator.sol**:  it is designed to validate off-chain signatures for parties. It implements the `IERC1271` interface from OpenZeppelin, which is a standard for contracts to validate signatures.
    
- I**mplementation.sol**: it is an abstract contract  This contract is used as a base contract for other contracts that will be delegatecalled into.
    

### Codebase Analysis

- The codebase is well-structured and follows Solidity best practices. The contracts are well-documented, which aids in understanding the functionality and purpose of each contract. The use of libraries for common functions helps to reduce code duplication and increase readability. However, the complexity of the system could potentially lead to unexpected behaviour or vulnerabilities.

## Test analysis

The audit scope of the contracts to be reviewed is 62%, with the aim of reaching 100%.

## Codebase Quality

- **Modular Design:** The code is organized into different contracts, each responsible for specific functionality. This makes the codebase easier to understand and maintain.
    
- **Clear Comments:** There are comments throughout the code that explain the purpose of functions, variables, and sections. This enhances readability and comprehension.
    
- **Use of Interfaces:** The code leverages interfaces to interact with other contracts. This is a good practice for decoupling and reusability.
    
- **Access Control:** The contracts implement access control using modifiers like `onlySelf`. This ensures that certain functions can only be called by authorized parties.
    
- **Events:** Events are used to provide transparency and enable easier tracking of important contract interactions.
    

## How could they have done it better?

While the provided code seems to be functional, there are always areas for improvement to ensure better security, efficiency, and readability in the contract and the protocol.

- Here are some potential areas for improvement:
    
- **Comments and Documentation**: Provide thorough comments and documentation throughout the code to explain the purpose, functionality, and any potential gotchas of each component.
    
- **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent unexpected behavior or attacks. For example, checking that input amounts are positive, non-zero, and within reasonable bounds.
    
- **Consistent Naming Conventions**: Use consistent and descriptive variable and function names to make the code more understandable.
    
- **Gas Efficiency**: Optimize the code for gas efficiency. This involves minimizing unnecessary computations, storage, and external calls to save on transaction costs.
    
- **Avoid Reentrancy Vulnerabilities**: Implement safeguards to prevent reentrancy attacks, such as using the "Checks-Effects-Interactions" pattern and using the reentrancyGuard modifier to prevent multiple calls to the same function.
    
- **Use Latest Solidity Version**: Keep up-to-date with the latest Solidity version and use its latest features and improvements.
    

## Possible Systemic Risks:

- **Algorithmic Complexity**: The contract involves complex mathematical calculations and interactions. Errors in these calculations could lead to incorrect outcomes, affecting the functioning of the contract and potentially leading to unexpected losses for users.
    
- **Rounding Errors**: Rounding errors can accumulate over time due to frequent calculations involving floating-point arithmetic. These errors could lead to discrepancies between expected and actual token balances, causing loss of funds.
    
- **Front-Running and Manipulation**: Complex financial systems can be susceptible to front-running attacks where malicious actors place transactions ahead of others to gain an advantage. The evolving nature of the bonding curve could provide opportunities for manipulation.
    
- **Unintended Consequences**: The interactions between different parts of the contract could lead to unintended consequences, negatively impacting users.
    

## Centralization Risk

All the governance controls seem like centralization risks throughout the code, as has been pointed out here:

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-party/blob/main/bot-report.md#m01-centralization-risk-for-privileged-functions

## Security Approach of the Project

- **Minimize Complexity**: Keep the smart contract logic as simple as possible to reduce the attack surface. Complex systems are more prone to bugs and vulnerabilities.
    
- **Separation of Concerns**: Divide the contract's functionalities into smaller, modular components. This can help isolate vulnerabilities and make the contract easier to audit.
    
- **Secure Coding Guidelines**: Enforce secure coding practices among developers. Follow best practices for Solidity development to minimize the risk of introducing vulnerabilities.
    

Remember that security is an ongoing process, and regular reviews, updates, and improvements are essential to stay ahead of emerging threats. Collaborating with experienced blockchain security professionals and conducting frequent security assessments can significantly enhance the security posture of the project.

## Gas Optimization

party protocol is generally efficient in terms of gas optimizations, many generally accepted gas optimizations have been implemented, gas optimizations with minor effects are already mentioned in automatic finding, but gas optimizations will not be a priority considering code readability and code base size.

## Documents

The documentation provided for the party protocol is quite comprehensive and detailed in terms of explaining its functionality, parameter usage, purpose, and overall architecture. However, here are some suggestions that could further enhance the clarity and understanding of the documentation:

- **Visual Examples**: Include diagrams or visual aids to help readers understand concepts better.
    
- **Practical Examples**: Provide specific numerical examples to help readers apply calculations and parameters in real-world scenarios.
    
- **Detailed Use Cases**: Expand use cases to demonstrate how the contract applies in real life.
    
- **Highlighted Key Terms**: Boldly highlight technical terms when first mentioned to help readers identify important concepts.
    

## Recommendations:

To enhance the security posture of the party protocol, several measures can be considered. Implementing extra security mechanisms like timelock delay consensus or requiring multisig approvals for critical changes can provide an extra layer of protection. Introducing a decentralized validation process for significant upgrades could help ensure that changes are authorized by a broader consensus. Additionally, documentation should be improved to provide comprehensive insights into roles, responsibilities, and interactions within the system. Thorough testing, particularly focused on upgrade and timelock processes, is essential for identifying and mitigating potential vulnerabilities. For further assurance, a formal audit by a reputable smart contract security firm is highly recommended.

## Conclusion

In general, the `party project` exhibits an interesting and well-developed architecture we believe the team has done a good job regarding the code, but the identified risks need to be addressed, and measures should be implemented to protect the protocol from potential malicious use cases. Additionally, it is recommended to improve the documentation and comments in the code to enhance understanding and collaboration among developers. It is also highly recommended that the team continues to invest in security measures such as mitigation reviews, audits, and bug bounty programs to maintain the security and reliability of the project.
