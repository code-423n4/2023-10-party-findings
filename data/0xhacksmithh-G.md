### [Gas-0] Unnecessary TypeCasting

```diff
```

```



### [Gas-0] Instead of `value + 1`, `unchecked{ ++value }` could be used

```diff

### [Gas-0] Redundant state variable getters

```diff
```
```
```



### [Gas-0] Instead of `type(uint96).max`, `VETO_VALUE` should used

```
```


### [Gas-0] `type(uint256).max` should stored in a `constant state variable`

```diff
```
```
```


### [Gas-0] `2` times storage write to `info.values` could reduced to `1`

```diff
```
```
```


### [Gas-0] `info.values` could directly used instead of `caching` it to `memory`

```diff
```
