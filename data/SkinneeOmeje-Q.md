In the function accept() in PartyGovernance.sol, they is no check if the caller to this function is a member or has a voting power. This function only check the status of the proposal,  the lastRageQuitTimestamp and if the msg.sender has already voted. It then go ahead and get the votingPower at a snapIndex which can return 0 if the msg.sender has no votingPower and then emit the event ProposalAccepted(). An attacker could spam a proposal with this function and could confuse a monitoring system because it will emit an event with the name proposal accepted even if the caller is not a member and has 0 votingPower.
Recommendation: Call _assertActiveMember() on the function to check that the caller is member first in order to avoid spamming a proposal with false Vote to support a proposed proposal.
