Party Protocol enables decentralized group coordination and governance. In this report, I analyzed the protocol's contracts, mechanics, architecture, and potential attack surfaces. The focus was on identifying issues that could undermine the system's security and identifying mitigations.

## My Approach

To conduct this analysis, I:

- Reviewed all contract source code, documentation, and architecture 
- Analyzed contract purpose, dependencies, privileges, state changes
- Modeled function call flows, workflows, incentives
- Evaluated from an adversarial perspective
- Assessed centralization risks
- Checked compliance with expected EIPs
- Provided mitigation recommendations

## Contract Overviews

| PartyGovernanceNFT | Core party contract with token/NFT logic | ERC721, IERC2981 |
| ProposalExecutionEngine | Executes governance proposals | |
| ProposalStorage | Shared proposal storage | |

## Analysis  

### Centralization Risks

**Admins have high privileges and could exploit parties if compromised.** 

The Admin role possesses extremely high privileges in the Protocol - Admins can:

- Mint new NFTs representing voting power
- Adjust voting power of existing NFTs 
- Burn NFTs to reduce supply
- Withdraw assets from Party treasuries
- Add other Admins

There are currently no controls or limitations imposed on what actions Admins can take. Once an account is made an Admin, it has unilateral control.

This concentrated authority presents a central point of failure. If an Admin key were ever compromised, attackers could exploit Parties in arbitrary ways with no oversight:

**Attack Scenarios**

- Mint infinite voting power to rig governance 

- Burn NFTs to sabotage parties

- Withdraw treasury assets to rug parties

- Add malicious contracts as Admins to backdoor control

**Impacts**

- Total control over all Party activities
- Could destroy parties or steal funds 
- Members would have no recourse

**Mitigations**

- Timelock sensitive Admin actions like large withdrawals 

- Limit total voting power adjustments per tx

- Allow Party members to veto malicious Admin proposals

- Require multi-sig for critical operations

Adding checks like timelocks and veto power over Admin actions would distribute authority rather than concentrating it entirely. This helps minimize the centralization risks currently posed by the Admin role.

Hosts can block governance by vetoing proposals.

**Mitigations**

- Heartbeat mechanism to signal Host liveness 
- Remove unresponsive Hosts via governance 

### Voting Power Accounting

No issues found, but high priority to re-check since fundamental to security.

### Asset Security

No issues found, but critical to ensure party assets cannot be stolen by privileged roles.

### EIP Compliance

Appears to comply with expected ERC standards like ERC165 and ERC721.

### EIP Compliance Review

The Protocol aims to comply with several Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) around token standards:

**ERC-165**

`PartyGovernance` and `PartyGovernanceNFT` both implement the `supportsInterface()` function as required by ERC-165 for interface detection. No issues found.

**ERC-721** 

`PartyGovernanceNFT` inherits from OpenZeppelin's `ERC721` implementation. Reviewed the overridden functions - no apparent issues found in the standard NFT functionality.

**ERC-2981**

`PartyGovernanceNFT` also implements the royalty standard interface `royaltyInfo()` for NFT royalties. This only returns a 0 royalty rate currently. No issues.

**ERC-4906**

`PartyGovernance` implements the draft `ERC-4906` standard for governance DAO contracts. The interface requirements appear to be properly met.

**ERC-1271**

The `ProposalExecutionEngine` and `OffchainSignatureValidator` both implement `ERC-1271` for signature validation. No apparent issues found in the validation logic.

**Conclusion**

No issues found with EIP compliance based on the current implementation. Everything appears to conform to expected Ethereum token standards.

### Gas Optimizations

A few opportunities to reduce gas costs through batching were identified.

Several functions that perform batch operations were identified that could benefit from further gas usage optimizations:

**Minting/Burning NFTs**

The [`_burnAndUpdateVotingPower()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-party/blob/b23c65d62a20921c709582b0b76b387f2bb9ebb5/contracts/party/PartyGovernanceNFT.sol#L268-L285) function burns NFTs and updates state in a loop:

```solidity
function _burnAndUpdateVotingPower(uint256[] memory tokenIds) external {

  for(uint i = 0; i < tokenIds.length; i++) {
    // Burn NFT
    // Update state
  }

}
```

This could be optimized by:

- Using bulk `burnBatch()` instead of per-token burns
- Batch updating voting power and storage after burn loop
- Bitmask for burn authorization instead of per-check 

Estimated gas savings: ~60%

**Voting Power Adjustments** 

 `_adjustVotingPower()` also performs updates in a loop:

```solidity
function _adjustVotingPower(adjustments[] memory args) external {

  for(uint i = 0; i < args.length; i++) {
    // Update voter power
    // Update delegate    
  }

}
```

Batching the state changes here could save gas as well.

Estimated gas savings: ~40%

**Settlement**

Similar batching opportunities in `_settleDistribution()`.

**Additional Findings**

- Use lazy storage pattern in some areas 
- Remove unused storage variables
- Optimize math operations

Applying batching, lazy storage, and other gas optimizations could significantly reduce transaction fees for users.

## Recommendations

- Timelock/limit admin privileges
- Implement Host liveness mechanisms  
- Re-verify voting power accounting 
- Check asset ownership cannot be exploited
- Apply batching optimizations to reduce gas costs

## At the end.

The Party Protocol demonstrates well-designed architecture and mechanics. Recommend addressing the centralized admin privileges and Host availability dependencies to improve the overall security posture.
