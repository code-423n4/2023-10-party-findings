## Approach taken in evaluating the codebase
##### Duration of Audit: 9 days (30+ Hours of Focused Work)
1. Day 0: (Pre-contest)
   - Explored the Protocol's Application, interacted as a user
   - Reviewed previous contest details and reports
2. Day 1: (Contest start)
   - Examined Contest README & Docs
   - Overview of Codebase & main functionality
3. Day 2-4:
   - In-depth codebase review, line-by-line analysis, and added `@audit` tags
   - Gained a holistic understanding of the protocol and its functionalities
   - Engaged with the Protocol's development team to resolve queries
   - Identified low-potential Bugs
4. Day 5-7:
   - Continued line-by-line review
   - Revisited `@audit` tags, either closing with `@audit-ok` or `@audit-issue`
   - Discovered 3 potential Medium Severity Bugs; wrote, PoCs, 1 got validated
   - Uncovered a potential High Severity Bug; wrote PoC to validate it and it got validated successfully :)
5. Day 8-9:
   - Compiled reports on High & Medium Bugs
   - Prepared QA report, Gas Report, and Analysis Report

## Codebase Quality Analysis
The quality of the codebase is exceptionally high, characterized by readability and auditability. Nearly every function is accompanied by inline comments, and developer comments are consistently precise, even extending to the test filesâ€”an uncommon practice. The codebase adheres to numerous industry best practices, reflecting a commitment to high standards. Furthermore, the documentation is commendable, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the codebase.

## Centralization Risks
The protocol itself is really decentralized, like there is no way for the protocol team (PartyDAO) to rug-pull any party. But the concern with the protocol is that it gives the Party's Host too much power. This much power could potentially lead to undesirable scenarios, such as rug-pulling users. Although the protocol emphasizes user responsibility in choosing trusted hosts, consideration should be given to restricting hosts' capabilities to mitigate risks.

## Systemic Risks & Test Coverage
The primary systemic concern arises from insufficient test coverage, currently standing at 65%, falling significantly short of the recommended 95%. This deficiency results in infrequent testing of critical edge cases. For instance, scenarios where a host abdicates their position during ongoing proposals lack comprehensive testing. The existing test condition only covers one specific case: when a host accepts a proposal and subsequently burns their position, ensuring that other hosts' votes are still required to trigger the "All hosts accepted" flag. However, crucial variations remain untested, such as when a host accepts and transfers their position to a new host, or when ongoing proposals are affected by a host burning their position without voting. Additionally, the situation where a host transfers their position to a member who has already accepted proposals remains unexplored. The insufficient testing of these diverse edge cases has led to the identification of one high severity issue and two low severity issues.

## Comments for the Judge to Contextualize Findings
I have submitted 1 High severity, 1 Medium, a QA Report covering 5 Low issues, and a Gas Report outlining 3 potential optimizations. Both High and Medium issues are PoC attached. The high-severity submission demonstrates a broken functionality and highlights how hosts can exploit that vulnerability to rug-pull other hosts and all party members. Confirmation from sponsors regarding the seriousness of host rug-pull issues has been obtained, particularly if there is a material loss. I hope my findings will be valuable. Thanks :)
