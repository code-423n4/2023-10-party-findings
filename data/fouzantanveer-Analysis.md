## Any comments for the judge to contextualize your findings
The Party protocol is a blockchain project designed to facilitate decentralized governance for parties through a set of smart contracts. It enables the creation and management of parties with a focus on governance, crowdfunding, and tokenization.
The core contract, `PartyGovernance`, serves as the governance logic for parties, incorporating features such as proposal creation and execution. The protocol employs a voting mechanism, with various parameters configurable through proposals, exemplified by the `SetGovernanceParameterProposal` contract.
Tokenization of parties is handled by `PartyGovernanceNFT`, which adheres to the ERC721 standard. Additionally, it implements ERC2981, providing a mechanism for royalty payment on secondary sales of party tokens.
Crowdfunding functionalities are implemented in the `InitialETHCrowdfund` contract, leveraging the base contract `ETHCrowdfundBase`. This allows users to fundraise in Ether for creating new parties.
The `ProposalExecutionEngine` contract is responsible for the execution logic of proposals, and it interacts with other contracts through delegate calls.
To enhance security, the project utilizes the `OffChainSignatureValidator` contract, which validates off-chain signatures based on the signer's voting power or membership in the party.
Overall, the Party protocol combines governance, crowdfunding, and tokenization, providing a comprehensive framework for managing decentralized parties on the Ethereum blockchain.
## Approach taken in evaluating the codebase
As an auditor, I began the evaluation process by thoroughly reviewing the project documentation and codebase to gain a comprehensive understanding of the Party protocol. This initial step was crucial for grasping the high-level design, key components, and the intended functionality of the protocol.
Once I established a solid understanding of the project's architecture, I initiated a detailed audit by delving into the code line by line. This hands-on approach involved implementing logics, scrutinizing modifiers, and assessing the implementation of critical functions within each contract. I commenced the audit by scrutinizing the `Implementation` contract, which serves as a foundational element for all contracts intended to be delegate-called into. This provided insights into the initialization process and the restrictions imposed by the `onlyDelegateCall` modifier.
Following the assessment of the `Implementation` contract, I shifted focus to the `ProposalStorage` contract, a shared storage bucket accessed by multiple contracts. This allowed me to understand how key components, such as the proposal engine options and governance values, are stored and managed.
Subsequently, I analyzed the `SetGovernanceParameterProposal` contract, a proposal type designed to enable the dynamic adjustment of governance parameters. This involved examining the execution logic within the `_executeSetGovernanceParameter` function to ensure secure and accurate parameter updates.
The next contract in the audit was `SetSignatureValidatorProposal`, which introduced a mechanism for setting signature validators associated with specific hash values. I assessed the implementation, including the `_executeSetSignatureValidator` function, to ensure proper handling of signature validator updates.
Moving forward, I evaluated the `OffChainSignatureValidator` contract, focusing on its role as a validator for off-chain signatures. I inspected the `isValidSignature` function, verifying that the logic for validating signatures and checking the signer's voting power aligns with the intended security measures.
Lastly, I examined the `PartyGovernance` contract, which forms the core of the Party protocol, providing governance logic for parties. This comprehensive evaluation involved reviewing functions related to proposal creation, execution, and the overall governance lifecycle.
This sequential approach allowed for a thorough and methodical examination of each contract's functionality, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the Party protocol's codebase.
