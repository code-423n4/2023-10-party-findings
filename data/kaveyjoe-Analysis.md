## Introduction

Party Protocol is an open protocol for on-chain group coordination. It provides on-chain functionality for group formation, coordination, and distribution, with the goal of making `Ethereum multiplayer`.

Party Protocol is built on three core pillars:

- **On-chain coordination:** Party Protocol allows groups to coordinate their actions on-chain, without the need for a trusted intermediary. This is achieved through the use of smart contracts and a `decentralized voting` system.
- **Crowdfunding:** Party Protocol provides crowdfund contracts that allow groups to pool their funds together to purchase NFTs or other assets. This makes it easier for groups to coordinate their purchases and gain access to exclusive items.
- **Distribution:** Party Protocol provides a variety of distribution mechanisms that allow groups to distribute their assets to members in a fair and transparent way. This includes mechanisms for distributing royalties, dividends, and other forms of income.

## Contract Overview 
**1 . InitialETHCrowdfund.sol** 

`InitialETHCrowdfund` contract is a crowdfund contract for raising initial funds for new parties. It includes features such as contribution, batch contribution, refund, and batch refund. It also interacts with several external contracts such as `ETHCrowdfundBase`, `ProposalStorage`, `Party`, `Crowdfund`, and `IGateKeeper`.



**2 . crowdfund/ETHCrowdfundBase.sol**

 `ETHCrowdfundBase` contract is a comprehensive smart contract designed for managing `Ethereum-based` crowdfunding campaigns. It includes features such as setting minimum and maximum contribution limits, defining a lifecycle for the crowdfunding campaign, splitting funds between the campaign and a separate recipient, and an emergency execution function for the contract owner.


**3 . PartyGovernance.sol**


The `PartyGovernance.sol` contract implements the governance functionality for Party Protocol. It allows party members to create and vote on proposals, as well as execute approved proposals. It uses a `ProposalExecutionEngine` to execute arbitrary calls on behalf of the party, and supports a variety of proposal types, including arbitrary calls proposals, fractionalize proposals, list on `Opensea` proposals, and list on `Zora proposals`. Party members can vote on proposals using Party `Governance NFTs`, which they receive by contributing to the party during the crowdfunding phase.

**4 . PartyGovernanceNFT.sol**
    
`PartyGovernanceNFT` is an ERC721 token contract that is built on top of `PartyGovernance`. The contract uses `OpenZeppelin's IERC2981` interface for royalty management. It also uses several utility libraries such as `LibSafeCast`, `LibAddress`, and `LibERC20Compat`. The contract has a governance mechanism where certain addresses are given authority to perform specific actions such as minting tokens, updating voting power, and setting the rage quit timestamp.


**5 . ProposalExecutionEngine.sol**
`ProposalExecutionEngine` contract is an upgradable implementation of proposal execution logic for parties that use it. It is designed to be used with a proxy contract that delegate calls to it. The contract supports various types of proposals such as `ListOnOpenseaProposal`, `ListOnZoraProposal`, `FractionalizeProposal`, `ArbitraryCallsProposal`, etc. The contract provides several key functions for initializing, executing, and cancelling proposals, as well as checking the validity of signatures.



**6 . ProposalStorage.sol**
`ProposalStorage` contract is an abstract contract that provides a storage structure for proposals in a decentralized governance system. It uses a pattern of explicit storage buckets, which is a way to manage and isolate contract storage in a more explicit and controlled manner. The contract defines several structures and functions to manage the governance parameters and proposal engine options.



**7 . SetGovernanceParameterProposal.sol**
`SetGovernanceParameterProposa`l is a part of a decentralized governance system. It allows for the modification of certain governance parameters, specifically `voteDuration`, `executionDelay`, and `passThresholdBps`. The contract includes checks to ensure that the new values for these parameters are within acceptable ranges, and it emits events when these values are changed.

**8 . SetSignatureValidatorProposal.sol**

`SetSignatureValidatorProposal` contract is designed to manage and validate `ERC1271` signatures. `ERC1271` is a standard for verifying signatures on-chain, which is useful for smart contracts that need to verify off-chain signatures. The contract allows for setting a signature validator for a given hash and retrieving the validator for a given hash.

**9 . OffChainSignatureValidator.sol**

`OffChainSignatureValidator`  implements the `IERC1271` interface. The contract is designed to validate off-chain signatures for parties. It includes functionality to set a signing threshold for each party and to validate signatures based on the signer's voting power within the party. The contract uses` OpenZeppelin's` Strings library and a custom Party contract.



**10 . Implementation.sol**

`Implementation` contract is designed to be `delegatecalled` into by other contracts. It includes a constructor that sets the implementation address to the contract's own address, and two modifiers: `onlyDelegateCall` and `onlyInitialize`. The `onlyDelegateCall` modifier ensures that the function it is attached to can only be called in a `delegatecall` context, while the `onlyInitialize` modifier ensures that the function it is attached to can only be called once. The contract also includes a function `IMPL()` that returns the implementation address.





## Centralization Risks


- The initializer function initialize can only be called once during deployment, and it sets up critical parameters, including the `gateKeeper`. If an adversary gains control over the deployer's private key or compromises the deployment process, they could influence the gatekeeper or other critical parameters.
-  The authorities list, used in creating the party, includes the deployer's address (address(this)). The deployer has a special role within the contract, potentially concentrating power in the hands of a single entity.
-The `OnlyPartyHostError` modifier allows only the party host to finalize the crowdfund early. This centralizes authority in the hands of the host, which could be a risk if the host acts maliciously or becomes compromised.
- The `emergencyExecute` function allows the DAO to execute arbitrary functions, potentially including critical operations. If the DAO address is compromised, it poses a significant risk to the crowdfund.
- The `_delegateToRenderer` function calls an external contract to delegate certain functionality. If this external contract becomes unavailable or compromised, it can result in a single point of failure for the entire system.
- The` _assertAuthority` modifier and related functions enforce a specific ownership and control structure. If this ownership structure is not decentralized or if the authorities are compromised, it can lead to governance issues.
- The `isValidSignature` function has logic for signature validation. If the choice of the signature validator is centrally controlled, it can lead to centralization of signature verification.
-  upgradable mechanism `(_initProposalImpl)` that allows changing the implementation of the `IProposalExecutionEngine.` If the upgrade process is controlled by a centralized entity, it introduces centralization risks.




## Systematic Risks

- Incorrectly configured exchange rates or funding split parameters may lead to unexpected results and financial losses. Ensure these parameters are set correctly and follow best practices.
- The use of `block.timestamp` for time calculations assumes that miners will timestamp blocks correctly. This could be manipulated by miners to some extent, and reliance on it for critical decisions should be done cautiously.
- The `rageQuit` function uses a reentrancy guard `(rageQuitTimestamp)` to prevent reentrancy attacks. However, any oversight in the implementation might expose the contract to reentrancy vulnerabilities.
- The minting functions (`mint, increaseVotingPower, decreaseVotingPower`) should be carefully monitored for potential gas limit issues, especially as the number of authorities and minting requests increases. Gas limits might be exceeded during minting, causing transactions to fail.
- The authorization checks in various functions (e.g., `burn, abdicateAuthority, etc.`) need to be robust to prevent unauthorized access. Any lapses in these checks could lead to unauthorized actions, impacting the integrity of the system.

## Codebase Quality Analysis 


- **Modularity:** The codebase is organized into distinct contracts, each handling specific functionalities. This modular approach promotes code readability and maintainability.

- **Documentation:** Each contract is accompanied by clear explanations of its purpose and functionality. This aids developers in understanding the code and its intended use.

- **Use of Libraries:** The project leverages established libraries like OpenZeppelin's IERC2981 and utility libraries such as `LibSafeCast`, `LibAddress`, and `LibERC20Compat`. This promotes code reuse and reduces the likelihood of implementation errors.

- **Governance Mechanism:** The governance system implemented in `PartyGovernanceNFT.sol` provides a structured way for party members to participate in decision-making, enhancing the protocol's democratic nature.


## Recommendation
- Implement multi-signature setups for critical functions, especially those related to the initializer function during deployment. This mitigates risks associated with compromised private keys.
- Reevaluate the inclusion of the deployer in the authorities list and assess the necessity of this central role. Aim for a more decentralized approach to distribute authority within the protocol.
- Explore options to distribute governance authority beyond a single entity, especially in functions like `OnlyPartyHostError` and `emergencyExecute`. This helps prevent concentration of power and reduces the risk of malicious actions.
- Mitigate the risk associated with external contract dependency in the `_delegateToRenderer` function. Consider fallback mechanisms or alternative solutions to minimize the impact of external contract failures.
- Reevaluate the upgradable mechanism `(_initProposalImpl)` to ensure decentralization in the upgrade process. Involve the community in decision-making to minimize centralization risks.
- Keep the documentation up to date, reflecting any changes made to the codebase. Clear and accurate documentation is essential for developers and auditors to understand the protocol's functionality.
