# L-01: Host can denounce his role completely 
the `abdicateHost` function is for Transferring  party host status to another. But using this function a host can donounce his role by setting new party host to zero adddress ! 

This concerns about a scenario  where there's no host in a party ! Which is not intended as some functionalities requires the host to be executed . 
```solidity 

function abdicateHost(address newPartyHost) external { //@q no options for adding a host ? 
        _assertHost();
        // 0 is a special case burn address.
        if (newPartyHost != address(0)) {
            // Cannot transfer host status to an existing host.
            if (isHost[newPartyHost]) {
                revert InvalidNewHostError();
            }
            isHost[newPartyHost] = true;
        } else {//@ci there should be atleast one host ig ! A host cannot just leave a party by itself ? 
            // Burned the host status
            --numHosts; //@audit could be zero ! 
        }
        isHost[msg.sender] = false;
        emit HostStatusTransferred(msg.sender, newPartyHost);
    }
```

### recommendation :
Last host should not leave the party ! 
Revert if there's only one host left .. 

# L-02: Comments state that pre-existing ETH can be used but it canâ€™t
It is possible to provide an initial contribution to  InitialETHCrowdfund contracts.

The initial contribution is processed when the initialize function is called.

In both contracts it is stated that pre-existing ETH is used for the initial contribution (i.e. ETH that is owned by the contract but not sent along with the call to the initialize function):
```solidity 
uint96 initialContribution = msg.value.safeCastUint256ToUint96();

```
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-party/blob/main/contracts/crowdfund/InitialETHCrowdfund.sol#L140
### recommendation :
Remove those lines of comments if thats not intended  . 
```diff 
 
-        // If the deployer passed in some ETH during deployment, credit them
-        // for the initial contribution.
         uint96 initialContribution = msg.value.safeCastUint256ToUint96();
         if (initialContribution > 0) {
-            // If this contract has ETH, either passed in during deployment or
-            // pre-existing, credit it to the `initialContributor`.
+            // credit msg.value to the `initialContributor`.
             _contribute(
                 crowdfundOpts.initialContributor,
                 crowdfundOpts.initialDelegate,
```
# L-03 : Minted tokenid is not returned 
The `_contribute ` function mints a token to contributor if tokeniID is 0 . But Minted TokenID returned by the mint function is not chcecked and returned to show to the user . This is a best practise 
```solidity 

        party.mint(contributor, votingPower, delegate);
```
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-party/blob/main/contracts/crowdfund/InitialETHCrowdfund.sol#L302
### recommendation :
Catch the return value and return .
