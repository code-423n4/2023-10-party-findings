## Gas Optimization Report for [Party-Protocol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-party) by K42

### Possible Optimizations in [InitialETHCrowdfund.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-party/blob/main/contracts/crowdfund/InitialETHCrowdfund.sol)

Possible Optimization 1 = 
- In the [batchContribute()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-party/blob/main/contracts/crowdfund/InitialETHCrowdfund.sol#L204C1-L225C6) function, each contribution is processed in a loop, which results in multiple state updates. By accumulating these changes and applying them in a batch, we can reduce the gas cost.

Here is the optimized code snippet: 




```solidity
function batchContribute(BatchContributeArgs calldata args) external payable onlyDelegateCall returns (uint96[] memory votingPowers) {
    uint256 numContributions = args.tokenIds.length;
    votingPowers = new uint96[](numContributions);

    uint256 ethAvailable = msg.value;
    uint96 totalVotingPower = 0; // Accumulator for total voting power

    for (uint256 i; i < numContributions; ++i) {
        ethAvailable -= args.values[i];
        uint96 _votingPower = _contribute(
            payable(msg.sender),
            args.delegate,
            args.values[i],
            args.tokenIds[i],
            args.gateDatas[i]
        );
        totalVotingPower += _votingPower; // Accumulate voting power
        votingPowers[i] = _votingPower;
    }

    // Apply the total voting power changes in one go
    party.increaseTotalVotingPower(totalVotingPower); // New single state update

    if (ethAvailable > 0) payable(msg.sender).transfer(ethAvailable);
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = This could save approximately 10,000 to 50,000 gas for the batch transaction, depending on the size of the batch. The savings come from reducing the number of ``SSTORE`` operations.

Possible Optimization 2 = 
- The [_createParty()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-party/blob/main/contracts/crowdfund/InitialETHCrowdfund.sol#L372C1-L435C6) function makes external calls to other contracts which can be better gas optimized by using ``staticcall`` if the function being called does not modify state.

Here is the optimized code: 




```solidity
function _createParty(
    ETHPartyOptions memory opts,
    MetadataProvider customMetadataProvider,
    bytes memory customMetadata
) private view returns (Party) {
    // ... existing code ...

    // Use staticcall for read-only external function calls
    (bool success, bytes memory data) = address(opts.governanceOpts.partyFactory)
        .staticcall(abi.encodeWithSelector(
            opts.governanceOpts.partyFactory.createParty.selector,
            // ... parameters ...
        ));

    require(success, "Static call failed");
    return abi.decode(data, (Party));
}
```




- Estimated gas saved =  Using ``staticcall`` for read-only operations can save around 700 to 2,000 gas per call, as it avoids the need for potential state reverts.

### Possible Optimizations in [ETHCrowdfundBase.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-party/blob/main/contracts/crowdfund/ETHCrowdfundBase.sol)

Possible Optimization 1 = 
- In the [_processContribution()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-party/blob/main/contracts/crowdfund/ETHCrowdfundBase.sol#L196C4-L273C6) function, cache [exchangeRateBps](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-party/blob/main/contracts/crowdfund/ETHCrowdfundBase.sol#L270) in ``memory`` to avoid multiple storage reads.

After: 




```solidity
function _processContribution(
    address payable contributor,
    address delegate,
    uint96 amount
) internal returns (uint96 votingPower) {
    // ... existing code ...
    uint16 exchangeRateBps_ = exchangeRateBps; // Cache this variable in memory
    // ... rest of the function ...
    votingPower = (amount * exchangeRateBps_) / 1e4;
    // ... rest of the function ...
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = Multiple ``SLOAD`` operations cost around 800 gas; caching could save this amount per read after the first.

Possible Optimization 2 =
- Inline the [getCrowdfundLifecycle](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-party/blob/main/contracts/crowdfund/ETHCrowdfundBase.sol#L216) call within [_processContribution()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-party/blob/main/contracts/crowdfund/ETHCrowdfundBase.sol#L196C4-L273C6) if it's only used there, to save on function call overhead.

After:




```solidity
function _processContribution(
    address payable contributor,
    address delegate,
    uint96 amount
) internal returns (uint96 votingPower) {
    // ... existing code ...
    // Inline the lifecycle check
    CrowdfundLifecycle lc;
    if (maxTotalContributions == 0) {
        lc = CrowdfundLifecycle.Invalid;
    } else {
        uint256 expiry_ = expiry;
        if (expiry_ == 0) {
            lc = CrowdfundLifecycle.Finalized;
        } else if (block.timestamp >= expiry_) {
            lc = (totalContributions >= minTotalContributions) ? CrowdfundLifecycle.Won : CrowdfundLifecycle.Lost;
        } else {
            lc = CrowdfundLifecycle.Active;
        }
    }
    // ... rest of the function ...
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = Function call overhead can range from 200 to 800 gas.

### Possible Optimizations in [PartyGovernance.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-party/blob/main/contracts/party/PartyGovernance.sol)

Possible Optimization 1 =
- The function [_getVotingPowerSnapshotAt()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-party/blob/main/contracts/party/PartyGovernance.sol#L904C5-L933C6) uses a binary search algorithm to find the correct voting power snapshot. However, it can be optimized by caching the index of the last accessed snapshot for each voter. This would reduce the number of iterations needed in subsequent searches if the same voter frequently queries their voting power at different timestamps.

Here is the optimized code snippet:




```solidity
mapping(address => uint256) private lastSnapshotIndex;

function _getVotingPowerSnapshotAt(address voter, uint40 timestamp, uint256 hintIndex) internal view returns (VotingPowerSnapshot memory snap) {
    VotingPowerSnapshot[] storage snaps = _votingPowerSnapshotsByVoter[voter];
    uint256 snapsLength = snaps.length;
    uint256 lastIndex = lastSnapshotIndex[voter];

    if (snapsLength != 0) {
        if (lastIndex < snapsLength && snaps[lastIndex].timestamp <= timestamp &&
            (lastIndex == snapsLength - 1 || snaps[lastIndex + 1].timestamp > timestamp)) {
            return snaps[lastIndex];
        }
        hintIndex = findVotingPowerSnapshotIndex(voter, timestamp);
        if (hintIndex != type(uint256).max) {
            lastSnapshotIndex[voter] = hintIndex;
            return snaps[hintIndex];
        }
    }
    return snap;
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = This optimization would save gas on repeated queries by reducing the number of iterations needed to find the correct snapshot. The exact gas savings would depend on the frequency and pattern of queries, but could be significant for active contracts with many repeated queries.

Possible Optimization 2 = 
- In the [delegateVotingPower()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-party/blob/main/contracts/party/PartyGovernance.sol#L451C1-L453C6) function, when a voter delegates their voting power, the contract iterates through the voting power snapshots to adjust the power. This can be optimized by directly updating the latest snapshot instead of iterating through all snapshots.

Here is the optimized code:




```solidity
function delegateVotingPower(address delegate) external {
    VotingPowerSnapshot storage lastSnap = _votingPowerSnapshotsByVoter[msg.sender]

    [_votingPowerSnapshotsByVoter[msg.sender].length - 1];
    _adjustVotingPower(msg.sender, 0, delegate);

    lastSnap.delegatedVotingPower = lastSnap.delegatedVotingPower + (delegate == address(0) ? 0 : lastSnap.intrinsicVotingPower);

    lastSnap.isDelegated = delegate != msg.sender;
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = This change avoids unnecessary iterations over the voter's snapshot array, which can grow large over time. The gas savings would be proportional to the length of the array, potentially saving thousands of gas units per delegation event.

Possible Optimization 3 = 
- The [supportsInterface()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-party/blob/main/contracts/party/PartyGovernance.sol#L333C2-L339C6) function can be optimized by using a static mapping for interface IDs instead of multiple == comparisons. This reduces the number of opcodes executed.

Here is the optimized code:




```solidity
mapping(bytes4 => bool) private supportedInterfaces;

constructor() {
    supportedInterfaces[type(IERC721Receiver).interfaceId] = true;
    supportedInterfaces[type(ERC1155TokenReceiverBase).interfaceId] = true;
    supportedInterfaces[0x49064906] = true; // Interface ID for IERC4906
}

function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) public view returns (bool) {
    return supportedInterfaces[interfaceId];
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = This optimization reduces the gas cost by eliminating conditional checks and directly accessing a value in a mapping. The gas savings for each call to [supportsInterface()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-party/blob/main/contracts/party/PartyGovernance.sol#L333C2-L339C6) could be around 200-500 gas, depending on the EVM's current opcode pricing.

### Possible Optimizations in [PartyGovernanceNFT.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-party/blob/main/contracts/party/PartyGovernanceNFT.sol)

Possible Optimization 1 = 
- The [burn()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-party/blob/main/contracts/party/PartyGovernanceNFT.sol#L263C3-L267C1) function iterates over an array of ``tokenIds`` to burn each one. This can be optimized by using a batch processing pattern that reduces the overhead of repeated function calls and state changes.

Here is the optimized code:




```solidity
function burn(uint256[] memory tokenIds) public {
    _assertAuthority();
    uint96 totalVotingPowerBurned = _burnAndUpdateVotingPower(tokenIds, false);

    mintedVotingPower -= totalVotingPowerBurned;
    _getSharedProposalStorage().governanceValues.totalVotingPower -= totalVotingPowerBurned;
}
```



- Estimated gas saved = By reducing the number of state changes and function calls, this optimization can save a significant amount of gas, especially when burning multiple tokens. The exact amount saved will depend on the number of tokens being burned and the current gas price for state changes and function calls.

Possible Optimization 2 = 
- The [supportsInterface()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-party/blob/main/contracts/party/PartyGovernanceNFT.sol#L113C1-L120C6) function uses multiple calls to the parent contracts to check interface support. This can be optimized by using a single static mapping that tracks all supported interfaces, reducing the number of external calls.

Here is the optimized code:




```solidity
mapping(bytes4 => bool) private _supportedInterfaces;

constructor() {
    // ... existing code ...
    _supportedInterfaces[type(IERC2981).interfaceId] = true;
    // Add other supported interfaces here
}

function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) public view override returns (bool) {
    return _supportedInterfaces[interfaceId];
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = This change avoids multiple external calls which cost at least 700 gas each, resulting in a potential saving of 1400+ gas for each [supportsInterface()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-party/blob/main/contracts/party/PartyGovernanceNFT.sol#L113C1-L120C6) call that would otherwise make two external calls.

Possible Optimization 3 = 
- The [rageQuit()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-party/blob/main/contracts/party/PartyGovernanceNFT.sol#L344C4-L448C6) function (love the name) performs multiple balance calculations within a loop. This can be optimized by moving calculations that do not depend on the loop's index outside of the loop.

Here is the optimized code:




```solidity
function rageQuit(
    // ... existing parameters ...
) external {
    // ... existing code ...

    uint256 totalBalance = address(this).balance;
    for (uint256 i; i < withdrawTokens.length; ++i) {
        if (address(withdrawTokens[i]) == ETH_ADDRESS) {
            withdrawAmounts[i] = (totalBalance * getVotingPowerShareOf(tokenIds[j])) / 1e18;
        } else {
            // ... existing code ...
        }
    }

    // ... existing code ...
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = This optimization reduces the number of times the contract's balance is read from state, which costs at least 800 gas per read. If the ``withdrawTokens`` array has multiple entries for the native ETH token, this could save 800 gas for each additional entry after the first. 

### Possible Optimizations in [ProposalExecutionEngine.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-party/blob/main/contracts/proposals/ProposalExecutionEngine.sol)

Possible Optimization 1 = 
- The [_execute()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-party/blob/main/contracts/proposals/ProposalExecutionEngine.sol#L248C1-L292C6) function uses a series of if statements to determine the proposal type and execute the corresponding function. This can be optimized by using a mapping to directly map proposal types to their handler functions, reducing the need for conditional checks.

After Optimization:




```solidity
mapping(ProposalType => function(ExecuteProposalParams memory) internal returns (bytes memory)) private _proposalHandlers;

constructor(
    // ... existing constructor arguments ...
) {
    // ... existing constructor code ...
    _proposalHandlers[ProposalType.ListOnOpensea] = _executeListOnOpensea;
    _proposalHandlers[ProposalType.ListOnOpenseaAdvanced] = _executeListOnOpenseaAdvanced;
    // ... map other proposal types ...
}

function _execute(
    ProposalType pt,
    ExecuteProposalParams memory params
) internal override returns (bytes memory nextProgressData) {
    function(ExecuteProposalParams memory) internal returns (bytes memory) handler = _proposalHandlers[pt];
    if (address(handler) == address(0)) {
        revert UnsupportedProposalTypeError(uint32(pt));
    }
    nextProgressData = handler(params);
    // ... existing code ...
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = This change eliminates the need for multiple ``JUMPI`` opcodes that are used for conditional branching, saving around 10 gas for each eliminated opcode. The exact gas savings would depend on the frequency of function calls and the number of proposal types.

Possible Optimization 2 = 
- The [cancelProposal()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-party/blob/main/contracts/proposals/ProposalExecutionEngine.sol#L207C1-L223C6) function checks for the [currentInProgressProposalId](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-party/blob/main/contracts/proposals/ProposalExecutionEngine.sol#L215C8-L219C10) and then performs a ``revert`` if it does not match the [proposalId](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-party/blob/main/contracts/proposals/ProposalExecutionEngine.sol#L215C8-L219C10). This check can be moved to a ``modifier`` to reduce code duplication across functions that require the same check.

After: 




```solidity
modifier validateInProgressProposal(uint256 proposalId) {
    require(
        _getStorage().currentInProgressProposalId == proposalId,
        "Proposal not in progress"
    );
    _;
}

function cancelProposal(uint256 proposalId) external onlyDelegateCall validateInProgressProposal(proposalId) {
    Storage storage stor = _getStorage();
    stor.currentInProgressProposalId = 0;
    stor.nextProgressDataHash = 0;
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = Using a modifier can save around 50 gas for each function call due to reduced code size and reuse of the same logic. If the modifier is used in multiple functions, the savings can be more significant.

Possible Optimization 3 =
- The [isValidSignature()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-party/blob/main/contracts/proposals/ProposalExecutionEngine.sol#L225C1-L245C6) function performs multiple checks and external calls to determine the correct signature validator. This can be optimized by using a ``mapping`` to cache the results of [getSignatureValidatorForHash](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-party/blob/main/contracts/proposals/ProposalExecutionEngine.sol#L226C1-L241C14) calls.

Here is the optimized code:




```solidity
mapping(bytes32 => IERC1271) private _signatureValidatorCache;

function isValidSignature(bytes32 hash, bytes memory signature) external view returns (bytes4) {
    IERC1271 validator = _signatureValidatorCache[hash];
    if (address(validator) == address(0)) {
        validator = getSignatureValidatorForHash(hash);
        _signatureValidatorCache[hash] = validator;
    }
    // ... existing code ...
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = Caching the result of ``getSignatureValidatorForHash`` can save up to 2000-5000 gas per call, depending on the complexity of the function. This is due to avoiding repeated ``SLOAD`` and potential external calls.
