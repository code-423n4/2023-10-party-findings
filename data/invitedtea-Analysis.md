# PartyDAO - audit analysis

- by InvitedTea |  @invitedTea  |  Vicky@Keybox.ai

## Project Description
PartyDAO is a protocol designed around the concept of a Party, functioning as a decentralized group Ethereum account with multifaceted capabilities. It is engineered to foster a collective approach to on-chain actions and governance in the DeFi space. Each Party is composed of members who possess membership NFTs, granting them a measure of voting power crucial for the democratic process within the protocol.

Members of a Party can propose and vote on various actions, steering the course of the Party's on-chain activities. These proposals are central to the Party's operational dynamics, encapsulating decisions that range from simple token swaps to complex strategic maneuvers. When a Party is initiated through a crowdfund, the contributors are awarded membership NFTs, with voting power that reflects their financial input, thus aligning governance with vested interest.

The protocol is built to enable a seamless and equitable governance system, where decisions are made transparently and actions are executed collectively. This approach not only democratizes financial actions but also distributes the potential rewards and risks among all participants, fostering a true sense of community in the digital finance realm.

## Key Concepts of the protocol for this Audit are

- **Precious**: A set of ERC-721 tokens custodied by the governance contract (Party), conventionally acquired in the crowdfund phase. These are protected assets and are subject to extra restrictions in proposals.
- **Party Cards**: NFTs (ERC721) representing membership in a specific Party. Each Party Card has its own amount of voting power.
- **Party**: The core Party contract itself, which controls governance logic, custodies the Precious, tracks voting power, manages the lifecycle of proposals, and is simultaneously the token contract for Party Cards.
- **Proposals**: On-chain actions for the Party to execute, which must progress through the entire governance lifecycle in order to be executed.
- **InitialETHCrowdfund**: A contract for raising initial funds for new parties, setting a foundation for members to collectively decide future actions. It includes functionality for refunds and party creation, with multiple ways to contribute to the crowdfund.
- **ETHCrowdfundBase**: The foundational contract for crowdfunding within the protocol, handling contributions, finalization, and emergency procedures related to crowdfunds.
- **PartyGovernance**: Controls the governance logic and tracks the lifecycle of proposals, linking governance actions with the Party's operational mechanics.
- **PartyGovernanceNFT**: Extends `PartyGovernance` by integrating ERC721 functionality, thereby tying membership and voting power to NFTs.
- **ProposalExecutionEngine**: An upgradable contract implementing the logic for executing proposals within the Party ecosystem.
- **ProposalStorage**: The storage component shared between `PartyGovernance` and `ProposalExecutionEngine`, implementing a pattern for explicit storage buckets.
- **Globals**: A single contract that holds configuration values, serving as a point of reference for various contracts in the ecosystem.
- **Proxies**: All Party instances operate as Proxy contracts that forward operations to a Party implementation contract, allowing for modularity and upgradeability.
- **Rage Quit**: A mechanism referenced in the contracts allowing a Party member to burn their membership NFT to withdraw a proportionate share of assets from the Party.


## Approach 
In analyzing the codebase, our objective was to deeply understand its intricacies and deliver actionable recommendations for enhancing the protocol's resilience and functionality.

**The audit was partitioned into the following 6 distinct facets:**

1. Governance and Membership
2. Asset Management

## Architecture Description 
**Architecture of the key contracts that are part of the Party Protocol**:

The Party Protocol architecture is crafted to enable collective governance and asset management activities on-chain, prominently on the Ethereum Mainnet and potentially other blockchains:

#### Governance Contracts (e.g., PartyGovernance.sol, PartyGovernanceNFT.sol):
- Handle governance processes, tracking voting power, and managing the lifecycle of proposals.
- Incorporate NFTs to represent membership and associated voting rights within the Party.

#### Crowdfund Contracts (e.g., InitialETHCrowdfund.sol, ETHCrowdfundBase.sol):
- Facilitate the establishment of Parties via crowdfunding mechanisms.
- Manage the receipt, custody, and potential refunding of contributed assets.

#### Proposal Execution (e.g., ProposalExecutionEngine.sol, ProposalStorage.sol):
- Conduct the logic for enacting governance proposals.
- Store and maintain the integrity of proposal data.

#### Configuration and Access Control (e.g., OffChainSignatureValidator.sol, SetGovernanceParameterProposal.sol):
- Establish and adjust the protocol's governance parameters.
- Control critical functions, such as minting and burning membership NFTs, and validating off-chain signatures.

#### Codebase Quality:

- The codebase reflects a high level of sophistication with clear emphasis on security, governance, and cross-chain compatibility.
- Contracts such as `PartyGovernance` and `PartyGovernanceNFT` exhibit compliance with EIPs and demonstrate a modular, upgradeable approach to smart contract architecture.

The Party Protocol's architecture is thus characterized by its governance-centric design, asset protection mechanisms, and a clear delineation of roles and responsibilities within its ecosystem. The approach is indicative of a mature and well-thought-out system that emphasizes the principles of decentralized governance and community-driven decision-making.

## Systemic & Centralization Risks

Upon reviewing the Party Protocol's smart contracts, several systemic and centralization risks have been identified. These include the governance model, asset management in contracts like `PartyGovernance.sol`, and potential over-reliance on specific roles like 'Hosts' and 'Authorities', as well as risks associated with the management and execution of proposals.

1. **Governance and Voting Power Risks**:
    - Concentrated voting power within `PartyGovernanceNFT.sol` could lead to decision-making being dominated by a few parties, potentially skewing the protocol's direction against the broader community's interests.

2. **Asset Management Risks**:
    - Contracts involved in asset custody, like those managing the 'Precious' assets, present systemic risks if not designed with stringent security measures. Centralization in asset management can lead to vulnerabilities, including mismanagement or targeted attacks.

3. **Role-Based Centralization Risks**:
    - The centralization of power in roles such as 'Hosts' and 'Authorities' could pose risks to the protocol's decentralized nature. Over-reliance on these roles might lead to points of failure if compromised.

4. **Proposal Execution and Storage**:
    - The `ProposalExecutionEngine.sol` and `ProposalStorage.sol` are critical to the protocol's operation. Any vulnerabilities or inefficiencies in these contracts could disrupt the governance processes or lead to execution failures.

5. **Trusted Smart Contract Risks**:
    - While 'Authorities' are expected to be trusted smart contracts, reliance on any central entity introduces risks. Smart contracts can have bugs or be susceptible to exploits, which could have significant repercussions for the protocol.

6. **Compliance with EIPs**:
    - Non-compliance with EIP standards in contracts that claim compatibility, such as `ERC4906`, `ERC165`, `ERC2981`, `ERC721`, and `ERC1271`, could introduce systemic risks related to interoperability and functionality.

7. **Testing and Security Measures**:
    - The absence of extensive testing methods, such as fuzzing, invariant testing, or formal verification, could leave the protocol vulnerable to unexpected threats.

Mitigating these risks through improved security practices, decentralization of governance roles, and comprehensive testing and auditing is crucial for the protocol's resilience and trustworthiness.


## Recommendations

1. **Expand Governance Capabilities**:
    - Enhance `PartyGovernance.sol` to support a broader range of governance actions and increase the flexibility and autonomy of Party members in decision-making processes.

2. **Improve Asset Management Security**:
    - Implement additional security measures for contracts like `PartyGovernanceNFT.sol` that manage 'Precious' assets. Consider using multi-signature mechanisms or time-locks for critical transactions.

3. **Reduce Role-Based Centralization**:
    - Reassess the centralization aspects within 'Hosts' and 'Authorities' roles. Introduce mechanisms for community oversight or limit the scope of these roles to align with the decentralized ethos of the protocol.

4. **Strengthen Proposal Execution and Storage**:
    - Optimize `ProposalExecutionEngine.sol` and `ProposalStorage.sol` to handle a higher volume of proposals with complex execution pathways, ensuring scalability and security.

5. **Ensure Compliance with EIP Standards**:
    - Conduct thorough compliance checks and testing against the EIP standards claimed by the protocol. Ensure `PartyGovernanceNFT.sol` and related contracts adhere to `ERC4906`, `ERC165`, `ERC2981`, `ERC721`, and `ERC1271` as appropriate.

6. **Comprehensive Testing**:
    - Expand the testing suite to include fuzzing, invariant testing, and possibly formal verification methods to identify and rectify potential vulnerabilities before deployment.

7. **Risk Mitigation Strategies**:
    - Develop and implement risk mitigation strategies for governance and asset management. This includes the diversification of asset custody and the introduction of emergency stop mechanisms in the event of critical system failures.

- **Continuous Vulnerability Scans**: Use keybox.ai to continuously scan the smart contracts for known vulnerabilities, ensuring that newly discovered threats are identified quickly.

- **Behavioral Analysis**: Leverage keybox.ai's behavioral analysis features to monitor for unusual patterns that could signify potential threats or attacks on the protocol.

- **Incident Response Plan**: Establish protocols for an immediate response upon detection of a potential security incident by keybox.ai, including automated pausing of contracts if necessary.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Integration**: Work with keybox.ai to integrate their monitoring systems with the Party Protocol's smart contracts.
2. **Configuration**: Configure the monitoring settings according to the risk profile and operational nuances of the Party Protocol.
3. **Testing**: Validate the monitoring setup through simulated scenarios to ensure the system accurately detects and alerts on potential issues.
4. **Training**: Train the development and security teams on the use of keybox.ai's dashboard and alert systems for efficient incident management.

By incorporating keybox.ai's continuous monitoring services, the Party Protocol can maintain a proactive stance against threats and enhance the security for all its members.


## Conclusion

In sum, the Party Protocol's architecture showcases a carefully considered and complex design, indicative of a dedicated development effort to create a robust and flexible governance framework. The integration of NFTs for membership representation and the detailed governance processes reflect a nuanced approach to decentralized decision-making. Nonetheless, the identified systemic and centralization risks warrant immediate attention to safeguard the protocol's integrity and the interests of its members.

It is crucial to enhance the documentation and expand in-code commentary, particularly for contracts with significant operational roles such as `PartyGovernance.sol` and `ProposalExecutionEngine.sol`. This will not only improve clarity for current and future developers but also for the broader community engaging with the protocol.

The development team is encouraged to sustain their security-focused mindset. This can be achieved by initiating consistent mitigation reviews, conducting regular audits, and setting up a bug bounty program to detect and address vulnerabilities proactively. By implementing these recommendations, the Party Protocol can significantly reinforce its security posture and maintain its trust within the community.
