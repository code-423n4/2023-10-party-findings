## Summary

### Low Risk Issues
- 1- Missing update the Status to `Defeated`
- 2- A malicious proposer could set `cancelDelay` to a large value
- 3- Potential of out-of-gas
- 4- users with zero voting power could make a proposal `propose()`
- 5-  `Ready` proposal could get vetoed after passing the `executionDelay`
- 6- This will make the proposal to wait for the execution delay even if all hosts have accepted


## Low Risk Issues

### 01- Missing update the Status to `Defeated`
the Proposal should enter the Status `Defeated` if it exceeds its voting window without reaching `passThresholdBps`.
There is no check for this in `accept()`. so if this happened you should update `pv.votes = type(uint96).max`

*There is one instance of this issue:*
*GitHub*: [L595-L658](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-party/blob/main/contracts/party/PartyGovernance.sol#L595-L658)

### 02- A malicious proposer could set `cancelDelay` to a large value
If the `globalMaxCancelDelay == 0` in the Party. malicious proposer could set `cancelDelay` to a big value So no one can use this party anymore because his Proposal will stay in the InProgress status

*There is one instance of this issue:*
*GitHub*: [L797-L802](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-party/blob/main/contracts/party/PartyGovernance.sol#L797-L802)

### 03- Potential of out-of-gas
in `PartyGovernanceNFT.rageQuit()` there is a for loop that could lead to out-of-gas
  so the users could end up leaving some funds in the PARTLY in order to invoke `rageQuit()` successfully

*There are two instances of this issue:*

*GitHub*: [L378-L396](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-party/blob/main/contracts/party/PartyGovernanceNFT.sol#L378-L396)
*GitHub*: [L406-L441](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-party/blob/main/contracts/party/PartyGovernanceNFT.sol#L406-L441)

### 04- users with zero voting power could make a proposal `propose()`
The `PartyGovernance._assertActiveMember()` should check if `voting power` is not delegated to another user

*There is one instance of this issue:*
*GitHub*: [L222-L228](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-party/blob/main/contracts/party/PartyGovernance.sol#L222-L228)

### 05-  `Ready` proposal could get vetoed after passing the `executionDelay`
It is not logical the `Ready` proposal could get VETO or anyone could front-run the transaction of the `veto()` / `execute()`
because both of them accept the Ready states.

*There is one instance of this issue:*
*GitHub*: [L677](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-party/blob/main/contracts/party/PartyGovernance.sol#L677)
*GitHub*: [L609](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-party/blob/main/contracts/party/PartyGovernance.sol#L609)

### 06- This will make the proposal to wait for the execution delay even if all hosts have accepted
We know the host could abdicate (Burned his host status) by invoking [PartyGovernance.abdicateHost()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-party/blob/main/contracts/party/PartyGovernance.sol#L457-L472) at any time.

on the [changelog tabel](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-party#changelog) one of the changes is to add functionality to skip the proposalâ€™s veto period if all hosts have accepted it. So Once all hosts accept a proposal, the veto period is skipped. This allows for parties to move faster.

If all the hosts have accepted a Proposal and one of them calls `PartyGovernance.abdicateHost(address(0))` the value of `numHosts` gets decreased.

In order to skip the execution delay the `PartyGovernance._hostsAccepted()` function should return `true`

```solidity
File: PartyGovernance.sol

1088:     if (pv.passedTime != 0) {
1089:       // Ready.
1090:       if (pv.passedTime + gv.executionDelay <= t) {
1091:         return ProposalStatus.Ready;
1092:       }
1093:       // If unanimous, we skip the execution delay.
1094:       if (_isUnanimousVotes(pv.votes, pv.totalVotingPower)) {
1095:         return ProposalStatus.Ready;
1096:       }
1097:       // If all hosts voted, skip execution delay
1098:       if (_hostsAccepted(pv.numHosts, pv.numHostsAccepted)) {
1099:         return ProposalStatus.Ready;
1100:       }
1101:       // Passed.
1102:       return ProposalStatus.Passed;
1103:     }

```

But due to the decrease in the `numHosts` value and the function `` only check in `==` number of the Hosts Accepted this proposal
it will return a `false` 

```solidity
File: PartyGovernance.sol

1122:   function _hostsAccepted(
1123:     uint8 snapshotNumHosts,
1124:     uint8 numHostsAccepted
1125:   ) private pure returns (bool) {
1126:     return snapshotNumHosts > 0 && snapshotNumHosts == numHostsAccepted;
1127:   }

```
should be 
```diff
File: PartyGovernance.sol

1122:   function _hostsAccepted(
1123:     uint8 snapshotNumHosts,
1124:     uint8 numHostsAccepted
1125:   ) private pure returns (bool) {
- 1126:     return snapshotNumHosts > 0 && snapshotNumHosts == numHostsAccepted;
+ 1126:     return snapshotNumHosts > 0 && numHostsAccepted >= snapshotNumHosts;
1127:   }

```
